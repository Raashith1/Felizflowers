When we collect data through the Site, we collect your personal details on a secure server. We use firewalls on our servers. When we collect payment card details electronically, we use encryption by using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) coding. Whilst we are unable to guarantee 100% security, this makes it hard for a hacker to decrypt your details. You are strongly recommended not to send full credit or debit card details in unencrypted electronic communications with us. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection and disclosure of your information. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you. You are responsible for protecting against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer.</p>

              		  <p>Every time you visit GardenTulipFlowers.ae, information is sent from your browser to our server log files, where it will be saved. The information transferred includes time and date or visit to our site, which pages were viewed, IP address, URL of the site that referred you to GardenTulipFlowers.ae, how much information has been stored and which browser you have been using.

                      Once we have all this information, all IP addresses are deleted or anonymised. Anonymisation means that your IP address is changed in such a way that they either cannot be linked to the original user or can only be linked through extensive research.

                     The anonymous information stored in this log file is then used to improve the shopping experience on the GardenTulipFlowers.ae website by making our navigation more user-friendly, finding errors quickly and directing our serverâ€™s capacity to where it is needed most. For example, this information allows us to work out our busiest times and plan enough server power for those times to keep our site running as quickly as possible.

                     You hereby give your permission for GardenTulipFlowers.ae to analyse and use protocol data to develop and optimise our online shop.</p>
